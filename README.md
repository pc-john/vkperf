# vkperf

Vulkan Performance Measurement Tool

vkperf tests various performance characteristics of Vulkan devices.
It is aimed at developer needs. It provides developers with performance characteristics of their Vulkan devices,
allowing them to make better decisions during the design of their rendering algorithms and the design of Vulkan-related code in general.

The tests cover six main areas:
* Triangle throughput
* Vertex and geometry shader throughput
* Attributes and buffers overhead
* Transformations
* Fragment throughput
* Transfer throughput

For more information, see [sample vkperf output](SampleOutput.md), [Tests overview section](#tests-overview)
or [Detailed test description](ListOfTests.md).


## Usage

```
vkperf [deviceNameFilter] [deviceIndex] [options]
   --long - perform long test; testing time is extended to 20 seconds
            from the default of 2 seconds
   --minimal - perform minimal test; for debugging purposes,
               number of triangles used for testing is lagerly
               reduced, making measurements possibly very imprecise
   --sparse-none - no sparse mode is used during the main test;
                   this is the default
   --sparse-binding - sparse binding mode is used during the main test
   --sparse-residency - sparse residency mode is used during the main test
   --sparse-residency-aliased - sparse residency aliased mode is used
                                during the main test
   --debug - print additional debug info
   --help or -h - prints the usage information
```
